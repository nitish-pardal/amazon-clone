external Libraries:
  these are just some java script code that is written by some one else and we import the code to be used in our own project and this is known as external Libraries.
first we need to load the file that we need to import from the internet and then import the file that is on the internet.

Why we use external libraries .
a. save time and save resources and time .
Dayjs is an external library that helps us to work with the dates. 

note : when you need to do something complicated then try to find an external library for the work that you have to do.

use external libraries with modules: for this we need special kind of java-script library called as an esm version of the library (ecmaScript Module).
esm version : is just a version of the java-Script that works with the modules.

To use the modules along with the modules you need to import the functions that you have to use in the files . 
 for libraries you can straight away type their names instead of typin the funtion that you need to use .
 The syntax for this is called as default Syntax. 
 Default export : When you just want to export one content from this file then you can use this .
 A java-script file can have only one default export .
 and this works without the curly brackets.

NAMED-export:
this is the usual export that we use with the curly braces.
